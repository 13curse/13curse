## Hello 👋

I'm Sarah, currently a **student** at **42 Nice** 🇫🇷

I'm interested in **video games** 🎮 (my favorite one is Red Dead Redemption 2), **manual crafting** 🖍️ (making jewelry and drawing)  and **music**. 🎧

Below you will be able to **get a look** at few **projects** that I have made solo or with teammates.
Have fun testing the programs and trying to break my code!
